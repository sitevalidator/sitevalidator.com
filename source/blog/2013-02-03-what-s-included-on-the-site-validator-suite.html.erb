Site Validator offers an alternative, yet fully compliant with the W3C validation software, way to validate the HTML and CSS markup on your sites. It's a really easy to use service (just enter your URL and click Validate), but it's a comprehensive suite of tools that work together to give you detailed reports <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/s/3c085843df0ee18f78003d1d">like this one</a>.<br><br>All subscription plans have a 30-days money back guarantee and you can cancel anytime, so why not give Site Validator a try with your sites?<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/pricing">Start by choosing a plan</a><br><br><b>OK, so, what's included on the Site Validator suite?</b><br><br>Our validator suite currently integrates these tools:<br><br><ul><li><b>HTML validator</b>. Using the same software that the W3C Validator uses, but with the results displayed in an alternative, more intuitive, way. Includes HTML5. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/s/cbf35b792a90aa46958f83ca015a08cbe5f72ae9/r/html">See a sample HTML report</a>.</li><li><b>CSS validator</b>. We validate CSS for the&nbsp;pages on your site, again using the same software created by the W3C, and displaying them in an easier to understand, alternative report style. Includes CSS3 validation. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/s/cbf35b792a90aa46958f83ca015a08cbe5f72ae9/r/css">See a sample CSS report</a>.</li><li><b>Web crawler</b>. Our automated web spider takes care of crawling your sites in search of the internal pages, so there's no need to manually submit each of the pages (as the current W3C Validator requires). Enter your URL, click Validate, and see your pages being validated automatically for you. Our crawler also accepts XML sitemaps if you want to specify the exact pages to be validated.</li><li><b>Summary report</b>. As the pages get validated, you'll see a summary report for your whole site that, in one page, shows you all the common, grouped errors that are found on your site. A much cleaner, faster and easier to understand alternative to having to study each individual page report. It allows you to have a "big picture" idea of the main validation problems on your sites.</li><li><b>Per-URL report</b>. You also get a specific, per-URL report where you can see the number of HTML and CSS errors and warning for each individual page, with a link to the detailed W3C report for each page. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/s/cbf35b792a90aa46958f83ca015a08cbe5f72ae9">See a sample per-URL report</a>.</li><li><b>Check, Fix, Re-check flow</b>. Once you get your validation report, you'll probably start to work on fixing those errors and, once fixed, you'll want to ensure their validation by re-checking them. Using Site Validator, you can choose to re-check individual pages, or request a complete re-check of the site.</li><li><b>Unlimited storage of site reports</b>. You can store as many site reports as you like on your Site Validator account. While other tools delete the results after some days, we let you keep them for as long as you wish, as long as you keep your user account active.</li><li><b>Community forum</b>. An open forum for all web developers interested in markup validation. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forum.sitevalidator.com">Site Validator Forum</a>.</li></ul>If you want to stay up-to-date with the new features and improvements&nbsp;we add to Site Validator, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eepurl.com/i9J4z">subscribe to the newsletter</a> (and you'll get a free report for your site).
