We've improved the site validation reports and from now on, we'll include <b>code snippets</b> on the page validation reports. This way&nbsp;you can <b>easily spot where exactly those HTML and CSS errors appea</b>r on your pages.<br><br>Let us show you what's new on the validation reports:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/14/three_quarters_reports01.png"><br><br>Now, when you click on each validated URL for your sites, you'll see a full-page report instead of a modal window. There, you'll find tabs for the HTML and CSS errors and warnings. A button lets you re-check individual pages from here, so you can easily re-validate them after you fix the errors.<br><br>When you click on an error message, it will unfold to show you more details about it. For each error, it will show you where exactly it's found on your page, showing the coordinates and a code snippet. Also, when available, you'll find an <b>explanation of the error message</b>, and a link to the Knowledge Base if you need to discuss this with the community.<br><br>Clicking on the Line and Column coordinates will open a new window where you'll be able to see the full source code for the file, and you'll be taken to the line where the error has been found. <b>This allows you to see the error in its full context</b>:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/15/reports02.png"><br><br>For CSS validations, you'll be shown its context and the place it was found. You can also click on the coordinates to see the full source code of the CSS file:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/16/three_quarters_reports03.png"><br><br>Code snippets will be available on your reports as soon as you re-check them.<br>If you want to see an example of this new feature, check out our <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/s/3c085843df0ee18f78003d1d">demo site validation report</a>.<br><br>We hope this simplifies even more the task of validating your sites!&nbsp;<br><br>And remember, if you haven't yet signed up for Site Validator, you're only <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/pricing">one click away</a> to begin validating your sites.
